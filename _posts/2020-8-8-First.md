# So i made a discord bot
### The bot is verry simple  this is what it can do:
  - Check The Amount of players on a minecraft server
  - Check the max players on a minecrfat server
  - see the ip
### But one disatvantage is that its only set to check one server.

## I call the bot     Vjnce Sserver Checker

### You can see the commands by doing !help  and you can check the server status with !mc
